# Runtime configuration reference

This reference preserves Proton's inherited runtime options for developers of
this experimental Vanguard compatibility effort. None of these options
establishes Vanguard acceptance or League of Legends playability. For current
results, use the [implementation record](vanguard-implementation-progress.md).
See [building](BUILDING.md) and [testing](TESTING.md) before experimenting.
Runtime options that alter reported hardware or compatibility behavior are
upstream options; their documentation is not a Vanguard workaround or an
instruction to fabricate platform evidence.

## Proton options

Proton can be tuned at runtime to help certain games run. The Steam client sets
some options for known games using the `STEAM_COMPAT_CONFIG` variable.
You can override these options using the environment variables described below.

The best way to set these environment overrides for all games is by renaming
`user_settings.sample.py` to `user_settings.py` and modifying it appropriately.
This file is located in the Proton installation directory in your Steam library
(often `~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Proton #.#`).

If you want to change the runtime configuration for a specific game, you can
use the `Set Launch Options` setting in the game's `Properties` dialog in the
Steam client. Set the variable, followed by `%command%`. For example, input
"`PROTON_USE_WINED3D=1 %command%`" to use the OpenGL-based wined3d renderer
instead of the Vulkan-based DXVK renderer.

To enable an option, set the variable to a non-`0` value.  To disable an
option, set the variable to `0`. To use Steam's default configuration, do
not specify the variable at all.

All of the below are runtime options. They do not make permanent changes to
the Wine prefix. Removing the option will revert to the previous behavior.

| Compat config string  | Environment Variable               | Description  |
| :-------------------- | :--------------------------------- | :----------- |
|                       | `PROTON_LOG`                       | Convenience method for dumping a useful debug log to `$PROTON_LOG_DIR/steam-$APPID.log`. Set to `1` to enable default logging, or set to a string to be appended to the default `WINEDEBUG` channels. |
|                       | `PROTON_LOG_DIR`                   | Output log files into the directory specified. Defaults to your home directory. |
|                       | `PROTON_WAIT_ATTACH`               | Wait for a debugger to attach to steam.exe before launching the game process. To attach to the game process at startup, debuggers should be set to follow child processes. |
|                       | `PROTON_CRASH_REPORT_DIR`          | Write crash logs into this directory. Does not clean up old logs, so may eat all your disk space eventually. |
| `wined3d`             | `PROTON_USE_WINED3D`               | Use OpenGL-based wined3d instead of Vulkan-based DXVK for d3d11, d3d10, and d3d9. |
| `nod3d11`             | `PROTON_NO_D3D11`                  | Disable `d3d11.dll`, for d3d11 games which can fall back to and run better with d3d9. |
| `nod3d10`             | `PROTON_NO_D3D10`                  | Disable `d3d10.dll` and `dxgi.dll`, for d3d10 games which can fall back to and run better with d3d9. |
| `dxvkd3d8`            | `PROTON_DXVK_D3D8`                 | Use DXVK's `d3d8.dll`. |
| `nofsync`             | `PROTON_NO_FSYNC`                  | Do not use futex-based in-process synchronization primitives. (Automatically disabled on systems with no `FUTEX_WAIT_MULTIPLE` support.) |
|                       | `PROTON_NO_NTSYNC`                 | Do not use ntsync. |
|                       | `HOST_LC_ALL`                      | Set value to a locale to override all other system locale settings for a game.  This variable should be used instead of `LC_ALL`. |
| `disablenvapi`        | `PROTON_DISABLE_NVAPI`             | Disable NVIDIA's NVAPI GPU support library. |
| `nativevulkanloader`  |                                    | Use the Vulkan loader shipped with the game instead of Proton's built-in Vulkan loader. This breaks VR support, but is required by a few games. |
| `forcelgadd`          | `PROTON_FORCE_LARGE_ADDRESS_AWARE` | Force Wine to enable the LARGE_ADDRESS_AWARE flag for all executables. Enabled by default. |
| `heapdelayfree`       | `PROTON_HEAP_DELAY_FREE`           | Delay freeing some memory, to work around application use-after-free bugs. |
| `gamedrive`           | `PROTON_SET_GAME_DRIVE`            | Create an S: drive which points to the Steam Library which contains the game. |
| `noforcelgadd`        |                                    | Disable forcelgadd. If both this and `forcelgadd` are set, enabled wins. |
| `oldglstr`            | `PROTON_OLD_GL_STRING`             | Set some driver overrides to limit the length of the GL extension string, for old games that crash on very long extension strings. |
| `vkd3dfl12`           |                                    | Force the Direct3D 12 feature level to 12, regardless of driver support. |
| `vkd3dbindlesstb`     |                                    | Put `force_bindless_texel_buffer` into `VKD3D_CONFIG`. |
| `nomfdxgiman`         | `WINE_DO_NOT_CREATE_DXGI_DEVICE_MANAGER` | Enable hack to work around video issues in some games due to incomplete IMFDXGIDeviceManager support. |
| `noopwr`              | `WINE_DISABLE_VULKAN_OPWR`               | Enable hack to disable Vulkan other process window rendering which sometimes causes issues on Wayland due to blit being one frame behind. |
| `hidenvgpu`           | `PROTON_HIDE_NVIDIA_GPU`           | Force Nvidia GPUs to always be reported as AMD GPUs. Some games require this if they depend on Windows-only Nvidia driver functionality. See also DXVK's nvapiHack config, which only affects reporting from Direct3D. |
|                       | `WINE_FULLSCREEN_INTEGER_SCALING`  | Enable integer scaling mode, to give sharp pixels when upscaling. |
|                       | `WINE_USE_KWIN_HACKS`              | Enable KDE-specific windowing hacks that may improve experience with KDE older than 6.4 on Wayland and KDE older than 6.6 on X11. |
| `cmdlineappend:`      |                                    | Append the string after the colon as an argument to the game command. May be specified more than once. Escape commas and backslashes with a backslash. |
| `xalia` or `noxalia`  | `PROTON_USE_XALIA`                 | Enable Xalia, a program that can add a gamepad UI for some keyboard/mouse interfaces, or set to 0 to disable. The default is to enable it dynamically based on window contents. |
| `fnad3d11`            | `FNA3D_FORCE_DRIVER=D3D11`         | Force FNA to use D3D11 for rendering. |
| `seccomp`             | `PROTON_USE_SECCOMP`               | **Note: Obsoleted in Proton 5.13.** In older versions, enable seccomp-bpf filter to emulate native syscalls, required for some DRM protections to work. |
| `d9vk`                | `PROTON_USE_D9VK`                  | **Note: Obsoleted in Proton 5.0.** In older versions, use Vulkan-based DXVK instead of OpenGL-based wined3d for d3d9. |
| `noesync`             | `PROTON_NO_ESYNC`                  | **Note: Obsoleted in Proton 11.0.** In older versions, do not use eventfd-based in-process synchronization primitives. |
